I do seem to have a bit of a contrast issue with my buttons so changing these would probably be worth it in the future for better accessibility.

## BUGS

### Known Bugs

Sometimes the resizing can be a bit funny and causes the game to restart.


### Solved Bugs

| No | Bug | How I resolved the issue |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | The player would double job if multiple inputs were inputted at the same time. | To fix this, I added a tiny time when a player can't jump again |
| 2 | When the height and width of the canvas were set to 100%% canvas text would stretch | In order to fix this, I removed that CSS and made it so the text was responsive in js. |
| 3 | The player could go above or below the canvas. | In order to fix this, I added a limit to stop the player from jumping too high and the player dies if he goes to the bottom. |
| 4 | Players on mobile couldn't tell where the column was. | In order to fix this, I added a marker to make it a bit easier for them to predict. |
| 5 | Game would run at different framerates depending on the device causing jumps and other variables to be different. | In order to fix this, I made the game time-dependent instead of frame rates so now the values I set feel the same everywhere. |
| 6 | Making codes for Firebase a bit more secure. | In order to fix this, I added them to a different file and encrypted them so that while easily breakable they are no longer in plain text I also added rules to the database that only allows scores and names to be added. |
