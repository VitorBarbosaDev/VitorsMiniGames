| I would like to be able to guess the AI ship's positions. | The game allows users to guess positions. |  ![image](https://github.com/VitorBarbosaDev/VitorsMiniGames/assets/46977318/df09b351-ce9d-48a7-b588-7337cc901d2c)|
| I would like to be able to win or lose. | Once either the player or AI has cleared all ships they are declared the winner  |  ![image](https://github.com/VitorBarbosaDev/VitorsMiniGames/assets/46977318/ff3134b7-9575-4d08-8272-a0d5bfe58b49)|
| I would like the AI to be intelligent enough to make winning a challenge. | The Ai remembers the last ship it hit and will choose adjacent positions until the ship is clear | ![image](https://github.com/VitorBarbosaDev/VitorsMiniGames/assets/46977318/1bd6df30-21a7-4903-8fe3-502da7573bbd) |

## BUGS

### Known Bugs

No known bugs


### Solved Bugs

| No | Bug | How I resolved the issue |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | The player could place ships outside the grid. | added check to ensure this wasn't possible |
| 2 | The player could crash the game by inputting the wrong type of variable | To fix this I added string validation to all inputs. |
| 3 | The player board wasn't showing. | I was overwriting the player's board by calling the AI grid in the same method. |
| 4 | If you inputted h instead of H the game wouldn't place ship | I added an upper to ensure the string enter was always upper case. |
| 5 | The AI would continue to place positions even if off the board. | Added a check that caused the AI to go back to picking random if only the other option is off the board. |
