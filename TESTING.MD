## AUTOMATED TESTING

Automated Testing includes all the testing that is carried out by a program, like W3C HTML validation.

### Â CI Python Linter
CI Python Linter was used to validate the Python code

| I want to be able to choose where I place my ships. | The game allows the player to choose where ships are placed. | ![image](https://github.com/VitorBarbosaDev/VitorsMiniGames/assets/46977318/217add24-f69b-4471-8c3d-67c1ef906897)|
| I would like to be able to guess the AI ship's positions. | Game allows users to guess positions. |  ![image](https://github.com/VitorBarbosaDev/VitorsMiniGames/assets/46977318/df09b351-ce9d-48a7-b588-7337cc901d2c)|
| I would like to be able to win or lose. | Once either the player or AI has cleared all ships they are declared the winner  |  ![image](https://github.com/VitorBarbosaDev/VitorsMiniGames/assets/46977318/ff3134b7-9575-4d08-8272-a0d5bfe58b49)|
| I would like the AI to be intelligent enough to make winning a challenge. | The Ai remembers last ship it hit and will choose adjacent positions until the ship is clear | ![image](https://github.com/VitorBarbosaDev/VitorsMiniGames/assets/46977318/1bd6df30-21a7-4903-8fe3-502da7573bbd) |

## BUGS

### Known Bugs

Sometimes the resizing can be a bit funny and causes the game to restart.


### Solved Bugs

| No | Bug | How I resolved the issue |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | The player would double job if multiple inputs were inputted at the same time. | To fix this, I added a tiny time when a player can't jump again |
| 2 | When the height and width of the canvas were set to 100%% canvas text would stretch | In order to fix this, I removed that CSS and made it so the text was responsive in js. |
| 3 | The player could go above or below the canvas. | In order to fix this, I added a limit to stop the player from jumping too high and the player dies if he goes to the bottom. |
| 4 | Players on mobile couldn't tell where the column was. | In order to fix this, I added a marker to make it a bit easier for them to predict. |
| 5 | Game would run at different framerates depending on the device causing jumps and other variables to be different. | In order to fix this, I made the game time-dependent instead of frame rates so now the values I set feel the same everywhere. |
| 6 | Making codes for Firebase a bit more secure. | In order to fix this, I added them to a different file and encrypted them so that while easily breakable they are no longer in plain text I also added rules to the database that only allows scores and names to be added. |
